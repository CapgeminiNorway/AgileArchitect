## The Security Architect - Philosophy
The Security Architect has the potential to be the driving force for innovation and adoption of new technology. He must have a desire to understand the enterprise and it's goals. He must challenge himself every day to enable his colleagues, partners and customers to achieve their desired outcome of day to day operation. We think a Security Architect should act according to these principles:

- Helpful over gatekeeper
- Opportunities over limitations
- Practical over theoretical

And so the story goes ...........
