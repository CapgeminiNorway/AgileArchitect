# Social Science Analysis (Implications) of Architecture

Enterprises are social organizations that are built to accomplish specific purposes, and part of any analysis of those organizations’ architecture.  People in the business architecture respond to incentives created by the rest of the enterprise’s architecture.  The output of the enterprise, too, is the result of how people have chosen to respond the incentives created by architecture.  Security, for example, is usually bolted on, not built in, in response to business incentives.  

Enteprise architecture has been seen as “rigid.”  So has the Waterfall model of development.  Agile development and this initiative in Agile Architecture are responding the incentives (and disincentives) created traditional architecture methods.  This section of the repository develops the social science implications of architecture.
