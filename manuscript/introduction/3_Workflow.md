# Working together  

## Developing, sharing and publishing  
This chapter explains howto develop content:  

- Content is created in Markdown with any tool the author find useful  
- Content is stored and maintained using Git and GitHUb  
- Content is published from GitHub to a webserver at Azure rendered as HTML using mkdocs  
- Content is published to Epub, PDF and a selfcontained HTML using Pandoc  
- Content is published to Kindle using Kindlegen from a Pandoc output  

## Comments
For now the repo is private on GitHub, but as soon as this is public, normal comments, issues and suggestions will be managed from there.

## Webserver  
All content is shared on:

**Master content:** http://agilearchitect.azurewebsites.net/  
**Development content:** http://mkdocstest.azurewebsites.net

## How does this look
Below is an illustration showing the workflow:
