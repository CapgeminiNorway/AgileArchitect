## Culture of Collaboration
A foundational property of this architecture work is to develop a culture for collaboration. We believe the DevOps culture is a very useful starting point. So what is DevOps? According to Wikipedia:

> DevOps (a clipped compound of development and operations) is a culture, movement or practice that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.It aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.

We believe all Enterprise Architecture disciplines can adopt DevOps principles
