**Rationale** | Forcem Ipsum
**Implications** | The nature of team change to accommodate a tighter relationship and deliver in short timeboxes. Traditional project management is replaced with agile techniques (e.g. Kanban and Scrum) to facilitate delivery. Governance changes to accommodate ownership for solutions at a service level where decisions for changes are made on the fly. Cculture of "fail fast" and accepting risk is supported from the top
