# Cross functional lessons
The following lessons are independent of Architecture Discipline. They may serve both as a baseline training and specialized knowledge.

## Capgemini IAF
The Capgemini Integrated Architecture Framework (**IAF**) has been the
cornerstone of architecture led engagements across most of Capgemini for
many years. To date, IAF is used at many customers, used and developed
by the architecture community. As a result, IAF has evolved and adapted
over the years through the experience and thought leadership of the
Capgemini architecture community. Learning and education has been
through formal (A-Week events) and informal (on the job coaching). IAF
has undergone major revisions at intervals, with course and reference
material updated as resources allowed. This process has ensured that at
any one time, there are several ‘flavours’ of IAF in use, each involving
slightly different interpretations but still underpinned by a consistent
and robust set of concepts.

Recently, Capgemini has identified a need to communicate and share IAF
with clients and a wider, public domain community. It is therefore
necessary to establish a consistent baseline of definitions that can be
used for this dissemination process. It is necessary to present a
definitive version and interpretation of IAF Artifacts[^1] in order to
support this initiative.

## Archimate
The objective of the Archimate standard and the ArchiMate Enterprise Architecture modeling language, is to be a visual language with a set of default iconography for describing, analyzing, and communicating many concerns of Enterprise Architectures as they change over time. The standard provides a set of entities and relationships with their corresponding iconography for the representation of Architecture Descriptions.

Archimate training must comply to The Open Group specifications and requirements. For more information on this, go to their [Website](http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/archimate/training)
