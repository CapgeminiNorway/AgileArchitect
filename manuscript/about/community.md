**The Agile Community**

The agile and open community behind this work is a joint effort between Huawei and Capgemini. We believe Enterprise Architecture must embrace agile methods and DevOps to survive. That means each and everyone of us need to change. We need to operate in a transparent and open way. We need to share ideas and bear to hear the truth we spoken to be twisted and criticised. Only to come back with a better idea and a better answer. Just because we shared, listened and challenged ourself.
