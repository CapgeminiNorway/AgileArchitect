## Archimate
The objective of the Archimate standard and the ArchiMate Enterprise Architecture modeling language, is to be a visual language with a set of default iconography for describing, analyzing, and communicating many concerns of Enterprise Architectures as they change over time. The standard provides a set of entities and relationships with their corresponding iconography for the representation of Architecture Descriptions.

Archimate training must comply to The Open Group specifications and requirements. For more information on this, go to their [Website](http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/archimate/training)
