# Introduction to TechnoVision

**Need a complete rewrite**  

Digital transformation is challenging for all established businesses. The old steady known competitive evolution pace with known competitors is changing to a more disruptive and uncertain mutative race, with new and unheard of competitors. Competitors that are effective in copying and delivering products and services that they did not invent, yet they are defining new rules for production and delivery through new approaches to how to interact with customers and clients.

This is a development where it seems that market knowledge, customer relationships and tradition seems less important. However, it is actually the traditional businesses slow adoption of new technology and their lack of understanding how important it is to satisfy the customers and clients expectations to how to consume, that creates a gap in the market that new competitors can fill. The newcomers are hacking the established business models, but it’s actually established businesses that make their business models hackable, while they are focusing on building unhackable it-solutions.  Established businesses are stuck in their old thinking and principles how to build, manage and run their business. Stuck in thinking that all employee’s competence is bound to their operating business model and the solutions that supports it.
Established businesses need to rethink and challenge their principles and established truths about governance. Not necessarily change them, but assess and reflect how new technology, new possibilities and their market knowledge could come together to satisfy customers’ expectations and new behaviors. Are your business structures flexible and dynamic enough? Does your architecture and application landscape reflect the new business needs and new market demands? Is your attitude towards risk an obstacle for you to act as freely as potential newcomers are?  Are your processes as dynamic as they need to be?

It is difficult for established businesses to challenge themselves in these matters, and this is why Capgemini has developed “TechnoVision”. It is an open framework to organize perspective and trends a business should assess and reflect about regularly, but certainly when they start on their digital transformation journey. We call “TechnoVision” a reflection framework, -and it both guides a business through central perspective that needs to be considered, and informs about trends and possibilities within the perspectives.  The framework helps businesses to discuss the “outside world” with the new opportunities and technological possibilities, with their knowledge of their services and products. In this process, new requirements for how the business should be supported will be formed, and this is actually the important tipping point. The requirements should be stated outside in, and not inside out.  It is the market a business is a part of that states the rules of the play in the game, and not the other way around, established businesses seems to have forgotten this and are therefore submitted to disruption.
The framework contains 7 design principles for how the organization should work with digital transformation, Furthermore, the framework contains 6 perspectives with 30 trends, 5 trends in each perspective. Principles, perspictives and trends may challenge established “truths” and do’s and dont’s, but could also update and renew them to better reflect the actual technology and possibilities of today.  The framework doesn’t depict what is the right or wrong answers or solutions.  It is a guide for what you need to consider. TechnoVision framework are summarized in following figure.

We think that TechnoVision could be used as a framework to reflect about important aspects of the businesses architecture and application landscape. First we present the principles in “Designs for digital” to give an introduction of the framework.

# Design for digital
Design for digital contains seven principles for how the organization should work with digital transformation.  They propose a very different way of looking at business, users, technology integration, and applications. Unlike other frameworks   and if used successfully, it will mobilize the organization to have discussion which establish goals for the operation without the constraints wich infrastructure, applications and work processes defines.  The seven principles are:

- Digitally intense
- What‘s your story?
- Business Mon amour
- Bon Risk Appétit
- Trains and scooters
- Platform No. 3
- Hack my business model

## Digitally intense
This principle sets digital leadership on the agenda, and challenge businesses to reflect what a digital business is and how digital leadership differentiate a "Digital Master" from a "Digital Doer". What does it takes to become “Digitally intense”. For any organization to become a ‘digital master’, it needs to create sound digital leadership, understanding how technologies drive the creation of a superior customer experience, the optimization of operations and even the reinvention of entire business models. It also needs a Digital IT team willing, able and ready to catalyze Digital Transformation with the right mix and architecture of new technologies  — mobility, insights, social tools, solution catalogs, and the Cloud.
Digitally intense makes sense, and it’s sets the stage for how to reflect and attack other issues.

## What‘s your story?
This principle set the foundation for how to work with Digitial Transformation. The name may suggest differently, but Digital Transformation is all about people. Whatever solution is shaped, it needs to be based on an outside-in perspective, designed from a deep empathy for what drives the people involved. And as we are only human, we prefer compelling stories above a long list of requirements, hefty specification documents and multi-layered diagrams. The ability to tell a story, and even better to listen to a story, is critical in creating digital experiences that actually excite and delight.
All design thinking requires a good, compelling story. It is the key for humans to understand,  to share. Why not use storytelling and have dialogs how we perceive the story from our perspective (socratic dialogue) as a source of modelling the future.

## Business Mon Amour
This principle sets the interaction between the business department and the IT-department on the agenda. Digital Transformation needs a true fusion between digital capabilities and business change, not merely alignment.  The success is understanding the mutual dependencies to adapt and deliver  to survive. First, the requirements binder needs to go. Once seen as a bridge, it’s now often perceived as a barrier between business and IT. Instead, digital platforms need to build the inspiration to jointly assemble the right solutions for change. We have to let go of thinking that other part of the organization could do better, we are in it together. In the era of Digital Transformation, business and IT are condemned to love each other for one simple reason: business without IT doesn’t survive; IT without business impact, dies.
We use Business Mon Amour very intentionally, - and it underpins the power of the principle “What’s your story?” When in love, one speaks in a way that is easily understood by the partner — goodbye jargon! When in love, one spends lots of time together. Ideas are generated, separate strategies converge and become one, projects are integrated, responses come before questions — a single rhythm binds the orchestra. When in love, one experiences harmony and collaboration.
How are the interaction between departments in newcomers or the disrupters, - how was the interaction in your business when you was a start up?

Technology Building Blocks for Digital Transformation

Although the impact of digitization is not new, the digital economy is entering a new age that presents unprecedented challenges for all CEOs.
Digital tools are invading the business environment, provoking significant changes in the way we work, communicate, and sell. This has given rise to new opportunities and challenges, and has triggered the Digital Transformation of enterprises.
