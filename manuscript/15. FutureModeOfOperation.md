## Executive Summary

IT and CT are simultaneously merging and undergoing their most significant transformation in decades – a digital business transformation. This will impact every aspect of their operations, and those of their partners, such as Huawei.  

Every major CT organization has commenced their transformation journey. Huawei is positioning itself as a key ICT transformation partner. This paper introduces the concepts of the digital ecosystem, and the nature of the transformation journey that must be undertaken.  

This journey is not optional. Digital companies have seen a 200-fold improvement in time to value, and a 168-fold improvement in time to recover from incidents. For CT organizations, they must evolve to compete with better service agility and the ability to define and evolve complex cross-functional service offerings. They must merge their silos and re-engineer their processes to embrace iterative, incremental, rapid delivery of value through practices such as continuous integration, continuous delivery and joint agile delivery.

Huawei must also embrace these practices if it is to be seen as a credible consulting partner. We have already seen significant interest from key customers, such as Telefonica Digital, Orange, Telenor, and Celcom on this topic, and how Huawei can assist.
Huawei recognizes the importance of this transformation. Eric Xu (rotating CEO) identified this as one of the company’s top 4 priorities:

> Re-architect IT systems: Operators cannot compete with OTT with an as-is IT system. Huawei needs to provide a ROADS experience driven operations system (OSS+BSS), realizing Internet industry O&M and cost reductions.

The digital business transformation is a customer experience led transformation:

This feedback loop embodies the customer experience led “outside-in” nature of digital services that delight and hold customers to a brand. A new mode of operations is at the heart of this transformation, mapping these experiences to changes in services, processes and infrastructure.
