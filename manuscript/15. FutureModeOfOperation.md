V1.0 – First Release

## Executive Summary

IT and CT are simultaneously merging and undergoing their most significant transformation in decades – a digital business transformation. This will impact every aspect of their operations, and those of their partners, such as Huawei.  

Every major CT organization has commenced their transformation journey. Huawei is positioning itself as a key ICT transformation partner. This paper introduces the concepts of the digital ecosystem, and the nature of the transformation journey that must be undertaken.  

This journey is not optional. Digital companies have seen a 200-fold improvement in time to value, and a 168-fold improvement in time to recover from incidents. For CT organizations, they must evolve to compete with better service agility and the ability to define and evolve complex cross-functional service offerings. They must merge their silos and re-engineer their processes to embrace iterative, incremental, rapid delivery of value through practices such as continuous integration, continuous delivery and joint agile delivery.

> Digital companies have seen a 200-fold improvement in time to value, and a 168-fold improvement in time to recover from incidents!

Huawei must also embrace these practices if it is to be seen as a credible consulting partner. We have already seen significant interest from key customers, such as Telefonica Digital, Orange, Telenor, and Celcom on this topic, and how Huawei can assist.
Huawei recognizes the importance of this transformation. Eric Xu (rotating CEO) identified this as one of the company’s top 4 priorities:

> Re-architect IT systems: Operators cannot compete with OTT with an as-is IT system. Huawei needs to provide a ROADS experience driven operations system (OSS+BSS), realizing Internet industry O&M and cost reductions.

The digital business transformation is a customer experience led transformation:

This feedback loop embodies the customer experience led “outside-in” nature of digital services that delight and hold customers to a brand. A new mode of operations is at the heart of this transformation, mapping these experiences to changes in services, processes and infrastructure.

## The Digital Challenge

The ICT world has changed forever. Digital innovations, driven by technologies such as Cloud, network virtualization, APIs, and microservices, have forever changed the way not only that software and infrastructure is built, but how we evolve it, how we transition it to operations, and how we support it day-to-day.

Internet businesses and OTT players continue to take market share from incumbent players, such as telecommunications operators and Digital Service Providers (DSPs), who are slow to adapt to this new reality. This represents a clear threat to DSP revenues.
The digital enterprise is the new normal. The market demands the advantages of the digital experience:

    ROADS: Real-time, On-demand, All Online, Do-It-Yourself (DIY), Social.

Most importantly, this experience must not only be driven by the user, but there must be a zero-fault customer experience. On the Internet, there are no maintenance windows, only downtime. Digital means that services must be delivered immediately, not by overnight batch job. It also means the ability to rapidly evolve customer offerings based on real world feedback. That means changes to the way systems are designed and built, how they are operated and maintained, and how they are monitored and how faults are responded to.

All of this requires a new way of architecting, constructing and operating ICT solutions.

### Agile, Lean and the DevOps led transformation

The new digital approach to product and service development takes much of its heritage from the areas of lean manufacturing and operational management theory. This is about applying industrial design techniques to the software industry.

A key philosophy behind DevOps is the focus on experimentation and quick feedback loops, and the use of minimum viable products that are evolved rapidly based on this feedback. A key tenet of Lean is the relentless drive to simplify and weed out unnecessary work. All of this is intended to maximize customer value. Lean and DevOps put the customer experience at the heart of what they do. They do this through design thinking and breaking down silos to ensure a holistic view of the end-to-end customer experience.

For Internet businesses, everything is about scale. Automation is driven into the development, delivery, and operations lifecycles. For true digital services, this includes autonomous responses to changing conditions, such as auto-scaling in response to demand, and auto-repair of failed components. It also means automation of the entire release pipeline from idea to production. This is DevOps ground zero. Taking ideas such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment and building a culture around shared ownership and velocity from idea to production.

The result is a focus on tooling, automation, and culture that challenges existing ICT practices.

### A radically different ICT  

The contrast between traditional “waterfall” oriented ICT and modern “iterative” ICT is stark, and reaches across organizational boundaries:

Old World Approach | Digital World approach
---|
**Culture** |
Organizational silos and hand-offs | Shared ownership and high collaboration
Fear of change | Change seen as principal work flow
Manual fulfilment of most functions |   Ubiquitous automation
**Service Creation** |
Segmented products, introduced rarely |Personalized digital life
**Software Development**|
Waterfall |Continuous and Incremental: Agile, DevOps
**Quality Assurance** |
Manual testing |Automated build pipelines and quality assurance
**Infrastructure** |
Application specific, dedicated infrastructure |Open but complex cloud-based infrastructure
Application architectures defined by network design |Network design defined by application architectures
Bespoke infrastructure built once, then maintained |New, cloud-based infrastructure created for each deployment
**IT Operations** |
Manual configuration changes to critical infrastructure |Automated deployment to all environments
Risk managed through change windows | Risk managed through progressive activation
Pre-defined alarms and manual responses |Autonomous real-time response to error conditions **Processes** |
Processes biased towards “build once” |Processes re-engineered for high volume, rapid throughput of changes

In the new digital landscape, services must react rapidly to dynamic conditions, scaling rapidly in response to the unpredictable nature of changing demand or component failure. This ability to scale and respond autonomously is a key driver in the re-engineering of digital applications.

The new digital world has been enabled by foundation technologies of: Cloud and virtualization, APIs, and microservices. These technologies have provided an opportunity to re-examine the way in which ICT is managed; to distil the key processes down to their essence, and re-apply those principles in a way that leverages these technologies to provide a better way to manage risk and change.

This is an important point and worth repeating. The new digital world, when implemented properly, operates not only faster and more efficiently, but with lower risk and increased quality! The 2016 State of DevOps report1 highlights the value of adopting DevOps practices:

 | 2015 Survey Super High vs. Low | 2015 Survey Super High vs. Low
 ---|---|---
 Deployment Frequency | 30 x | 30 x
 Deployment Lead Time |200 x | 200 x
Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) |168 x|48 x
Change Success Rate |60 x|3 x

This table shows the relative results for key velocity and quality metrics in organizations that have embraced DevOps practices to varying degrees. As practices continue to mature, organizations see their lead time and success rate for changes increase, and their ability to deal with failure conditions improve substantially.

These gains are achieved by looking at the key practices of configuration management, change management, release management, quality assurance, and the software development lifecycle, and re-architecting them to leverage high levels of automation and new ways of managing infrastructure and code release.

The resulting digital platform forms the basis for innovation in a rapidly evolving world. The techniques and principles discussed in this paper are equally relevant in any IT, CT, ICT, CSP, DSP or other setting. i.e. This approach to computing (including networking) will form the basis of the next generation of IT based enterprises.

### A transformation challenge without precedent
When viewed in its largest context, this is a transformation journey without equal and one of the most radical re-inventions that most enterprises will have undergone in at least a decade, and possibly in the company’s lifetime.

Such a bold statement requires further explanation.

The traditional enterprise view is to see new product introduction as a project, performed relatively rarely (every few months to a year). Each such introduction project is seen as complex, expensive and risky. It is funded and tracked separately from normal “business as usual” work, follows a progressive “waterfall” process from requirements to design to implementation, and delivery is managed by project managers (sometimes several). The entire enterprise (not just IT) is setup around this product introduction philosophy.

By contrast, digital products evolve frequently and rapidly. This is the normal business-as-usual process. Products are developed, tested and released incrementally, via agile and DevOps methodologies. New projects start rarely, but evolve continually. Change is the most important work of the company.

> By contrast, digital products evolve frequently and rapidly. This is the normal business-as-usual process.

To be successful, a digital business transformation requires re-tooling the entire enterprise and its operating model, from relatively rare, manual activities, to an industrial model where changes are churned out at an increasing rate via a “production line”. Processes must be re-designed to support frequent, hands-free delivery, or they will not scale.

The question is: How do you make fundamental changes to your business processes without putting services at risk? How do you give the patient a heart transplant while they’re going for a run?
