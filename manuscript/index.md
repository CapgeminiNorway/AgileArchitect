## Going DEF: Digital (architected) enablement

The chasm between enterprise architects and DevOps teams prevents new digital techniques from leveraging architecture benefits, and from enterprises seeing the benefits of modern software development approaches. The result has been a "bi-modal" contrast of "new" versus "old"

Todays’ business is very different than it was a decade ago, and nowadays focus is on customer experience and rapid value delivery through digital technologies/practices
The existing frameworks and practices still offer value

We have an opportunity to augment it even further by introducing agile principles based on simplification, collaboration, automation, feedback-driven incremental evolution
Capgemini and Huawei are combining respective experiences to investigate this idea of a new Digital Enablement Framework, starting from its foundational principles
We would like to share this working draft and initiate an open discussion

## What is DEF?
We have created a “Manifesto for digital (architected) enablement”. The Manifesto is based on The Agile Manifesto that sets the direction. In addtition we highlight:

- Simplicity over elaboration
- Platform Concierge over Design authority
- Empathy and Observation over requirements
- Continuous transformation over phased change
- Automation over manuality

Going DEF is an initiative to help public and private enterprises with Digital Enablement. For architects to be useful in this context, we want to crowdsource the design and production of whatever it takes to turn architects into more helpful advisors for their stakeholders. DEF will focus on what kind of lessons and guides is needed for the first phase of this journey. It is not a journey with an end, but more about evolution.

## Our team is going to do further work that we will share, developing the ideas of this Manifesto:

- Based on best practices experienced in helping our clients’ digital transformation journeys
- Based on your comments/feedbacks/contributions or even criticism that we will receive

## Continuous Delivery -> Evolutionary Architecture
Architects must find ways to continuously deliver products and services to internal and external stakeholders. The products and services will evolve over time and consist of generic and specialized elements with their relationships
