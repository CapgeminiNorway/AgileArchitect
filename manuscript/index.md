<h3>The Agile Architect</h3>

The chasm between enterprise architects and DevOps teams prevents new digital techniques from leveraging architecture benefits, and from enterprises seeing the benefits of modern software development approaches. The result has been a "bi-modal" contrast of "new" versus "old"

<h3>Evolutionary Architecture</h3>
Architects must find ways to continuously deliver products and services to internal and external stakeholders. The products and services will evolve over time and consist of generic and specialized elements with their relationships

<h3>What about building architects</h3>
Is it relevant to compare with a building architect? The concept of blueprints should work for EA
