<h3>Current situation and the way ahead</h3>

The chasm between enterprise architects and DevOps teams prevents new digital techniques from leveraging architecture benefits, and from enterprises seeing the benefits of modern software development approaches. The result has been a "bi-modal" contrast of "new" versus "old"

The figure below  illustrates the problem and suggest how to solve it:

<h3>What is The Architecture Academy?</h3>
The Architecture Academy is an initiative to help public and private enterprises with Digital Enablement. For architects to be useful in this context, we want to crowdsource the design and production of whatever it takes to turn architects into more helpful advisors for their stakeholders. The Academy will focus on what kind of lessons and guides is needed for the first phase of this journey. It is not a journey with an end, but more about evolution.

<h3>Evolutionary Architecture</h3>
Architects must find ways to continuously deliver products and services to internal and external stakeholders. The products and services will evolve over time and consist of generic and specialized elements with their relationships

<h3>What about building architects</h3>
Is it relevant to compare with a building architect? The concept of blueprints should work for EA. maybe someone should interview some building architects and see if there are things to learn?
