# How to develop, comment, update and share content

## Developing, sharing and publishing  
This chapter explains howto develop content:
- Content is created in Markdown with any tool the author find useful
- Content is stored and maintained using Git and GitHUb
- Content is published from GitHub to a webserver at Azure rendered as HTML using mkdocs  
- Content is publsihed to Epub, PDF and a selfcontained HTML using Pandoc
- Content is published to Kindle using Kindlegen from a Pandoc output

## Comments
For now the repo is private on GitHub, but as soon as this is public, normal comments, issues and suggestions will be managed from there.

## Webserver  
All content is shared on:

**Master content:** http://agilearchitect.azurewebsites.net/  
**Development content:** http://mkdocstest.azurewebsites.net

## For offline and mobile reading
PDF, Kindle and Epub will be created and an URL for download will be available from this site.
