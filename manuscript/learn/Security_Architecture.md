# Security Architecture
Security Architecture is about securing the application or system from the ground up. In order for software to be secure-by-design one needs to implement security already in the requirements phase and through the whole development lifecycle, that is why secure development lifecycle (S-SDLC) is one term that is frequently spoken about. Since there is no "silver-bullet" when it comes to security it is important to enforce defense-in-depth strategy, which means that security controls should be implemented in a layered-fashion making it hard for an attacker to circumvent all controls without recognizition.
