## Rugged DevOps
The DevOps practice has been around a while is starting to get a foothold in
many organizations, at least on a theoretical level. This chapter will not go into details about what DevOps is, but in short its all about breaking down the silos
of different departments and teams. It is about working together for a common goal and its about automating processes. From the manufacturing industry there are many parables between DevOps and the manufacturing processes, which can be rediscovered in the novel, *The Phoenix Project* written by Gene Kim.

### What is Rugged Devops?
*Rugged DevOps* or *SecDevOps* can be used interchangeably, but in this guide the term, Rugged DevOps will be used. Similar to
DevOps, Rugged DevOps is a movement from around 2010 because software was not secured properly. It identifies similar problems as DevOps. It can be described as
the transformation of implementing security into the DevOps community.
