## Business Architecture Guides

Business Architecture consists of principles, methods and tools for the design and management of how the organization satisfies relevant stakeholders.

Compared to traditional building architecture that is often relatively static once built, Business Architecture has more focus on aspects of management and change as organizations are always evolving.
