## Why build a process oriented business architecture and what problems can you solve?

There are both general and specific answers to this. First let’s address some general answers on the level of principles. Then, we will look at specific problems that can be solved.

### 1. Why study work?
At the principal level, we can rephrase the question of “why build a process architecture” to “why study work”. Framed in this wording, multiple reasons come to mind.

Humans, animals, machines and software can perform work. Work is action with a purpose, and from physics we know that it is only through action that anything can be changed or achieved. This is perhaps as obvious as it is profound, but it is the main reason why studying work is relevant for all goals and future states a company want to achieve or obtain.

When working to achieve something, humans often rely on other humans and technology. This is especially true in organization as the objectives they are seeking to achieve are too large in scope, volume or complexity for any one person to solve. Large numbers of people working together, using technology, resources, and adhering to rules and constraints, generates a complex system. The task of coordinating and optimizing this system of value creation is a demanding task, and becomes increasingly so given ever higher speed of change.

However, as complexity increases, we must not lose focus on the fact that work is what creates action towards some goal, and work consist of activities / processes. From this property, all organizational complexity can be simplified, understood and handled by relating it to specific processes with their specific outputs and objectives. For example, a rule, document, machine, application, competency, security or risk barrier, facility, piece of information and even a human, only exist to support, steer or enable some work process to produce its output.

Finally, a process and a process model is not the same thing. All processes exist regardless of having been documented or not. If not documented, there is a high probability that they have lots of variation. Documentation of processes in the form of graphic models and text is a requirement to conduct systematic analysis and improvement.

The bottom line is that all organization, coordination, analysis and improvement of an organization and its value creation must be related to its work processes. If not, the organization, coordination, analysis and improvement is not systematic and scientific enough and thus prone to sub optimization and guesswork.

## 2. Specific problems that can be solved
We have now established that any problem in an organization should be related to work processes in order to be systematically understood and solved. Problems can be on a very abstract level or a very detailed level. To make this less abstract, here follows a (not exhaustive) list of problems in which process analysis and improvement makes up a large part:

- Problems with collaboration, coordination and responsibilities
- Problems with product quality, cost and timeliness (of all kinds, not only to final customer)
- Problems with customer handling and satisfaction (customer journeys)
- Problems with suppliers, coordination and logistics
- Problems with compliance, risk and regulations
- Problems with efficiency and effectiveness
- Problems with change
- Problems with IT-system requirements and specifications
- Problems with documentation, training and competency
- Problems with risk and security
- Problems with operationalization of strategy
- Problems with planning, execution, monitoring and corrective actions

In later parts, we will look at certain problems and how to solve them in more detail. It is also worth to mention that it is not a coincidence or “hype” that these problems span most of what an organization does and goes across all organizational divides. It simply follows from the properties of the concept known as process.
