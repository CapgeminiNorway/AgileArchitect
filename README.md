Content is managed using GitHub and published to readable format using LeanPub. LeanPub publishes PDF, Epub and Kindle files.
For easy browsing, content is published to http://arkitekturskolen.azurewebsites.net/. Deployment is automatic, it happens within a few seconds after pushed to the branch develop. (Deployment slots will be added soon...)

Content from the Manuscript folder is published to https://leanpub.com/devopsforarchitects/preview whenever anything is commited to Develop branch. It is published as PDF, Kindle, Epub and Online. For now it is a private space. register a user and send an enmail to thorbjorn.ellefsen@capgemini to be added. Multiple roles is possible: admin, autthor, contributer and reader.


# Images  
All images are ideally created and stored as .SVG in the /manuscript/images folder. There are some online tools for SVG editing. One of them is from Google: https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/svg-edit-2.8.1/svg-editor.html. For now, we need to stick to PNG/JPG because we hae an issue with LeanPub on SVG. Powerpoint files can be used as placeholders for editable images.
