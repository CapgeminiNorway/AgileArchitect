# The Agile Architect
The Agile Architect is a an initiative to train and transform the way architects work and deliver value.
Content is managed using GitHub and published to readable format using LeanPub. LeanPub publishes PDF, Epub and Kindle files.
For easy browsing, content from master branch is published to http://agilearchitect.azurewebsites.net/. Content from develop branch is published to http://agilearchitect.dev-azurewebsites.net/ Deployment is automatic, it happens within a few seconds after pushed and merged. (Deployment slots will be added soon...)

Content from the Manuscript folder is published to https://leanpub.com/devopsforarchitects/preview whenever anything is committed to Develop branch. It is published as PDF, Kindle, Epub and Online. For now it is a private space. register a user and send an email to thorbjorn.ellefsen@capgemini.com to be added. Multiple roles is possible: admin, author, contributor and reader. We are investigating a slightly better option for this. Stay tuned.


# Images  
All images are ideally created and stored as .SVG in the /manuscript/images folder. There are some online tools for SVG editing. One of them is from Google: https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/svg-edit-2.8.1/svg-editor.html. For now, we need to stick to PNG/JPG because we have an issue with LeanPub on SVG. Powerpoint files can be used as placeholders for editable images.

It is also possible to collect models from Ardoq and store them as snapshots or live models. More details will be shared soon......
