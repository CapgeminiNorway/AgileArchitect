# The Agile Architect
The Agile Architect is a an initiative to train and transform the way architects work and deliver value.

# Browing content  
For easy browsing, content from master branch is published to http://agilearchitect.azurewebsites.net/. Content from develop branch is published to http://agilearchitect.dev-azurewebsites.net/ Deployment is automatic, it happens within a few seconds after pushed and merged. (Deployment slots will be added soon...)

# Content as readable files
Content is managed using GitHub and published to readable format like PDF, Epub and Kindle files. We use Pandoc and Kindlegen for this. See https://puppet.com/blog/how-we-automated-our-ebook-builds-pandoc-and-kindlegen

# Images  
All images are ideally created and stored as .SVG in the /manuscript/images folder. There are some online tools for SVG editing. One of them is from Google: https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/releases/svg-edit-2.8.1/svg-editor.html. For now, we need to stick to PNG/JPG because we have an issue with LeanPub on SVG. Powerpoint files can be used as placeholders for editable images.

It is also possible to collect models from Ardoq and store them as snapshots or live models. More details will be shared soon......
